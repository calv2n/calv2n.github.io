However, Gradescope lacks functionality of implimenting a course policy. An example of a course policy (Data 88S):\n\nAt first, this might seem like a simple problem to solve with some sort of code file (perhaps using Pandas & NumPy in Python or R). But we have seen with courses such as Statistics 20 that these course policies can get extraordinarily convoluted and error prone.\nThe current best solution for instructors to calculate final grades based on their course policy is to either of the following:\n\nParallel program two seperate code books and compare the scores against one another until they agree.\n\npros: very accurate\ncons: takes two programmers that fully understand the course policy & takes longer than single code book.\n\nCreate a single code book that can result in potential bugs that result in inaccurate scores.\n\npros: faster than parallel programming\ncons: error prone and still not a fast solution.\n\n\nThe Solution:\nGradebook: An interface that abstracts the code into human understandable steps.\n\nAn instructor (or reader) provides the web app with their course policy using the intuitive policy tab. Then, they can upload their course’s Gradescope CSV to see data visualizations, statistics, a final grade table, and more.\nWhat I Learned\nDuring my time with the Gradebook team, I was responsible for designing and developing the “Dashboard” which displays graphics and statistics so the instructor can visually gauge their student’s project.\n\nApplying Data Visualization skills using Plotly.\nGit and GitHub (including branching, pull requests, working with github in a team setting).\nThe importance of Teamwork & Communication in Data Science.\nWeb development essentials (incl. HTML, CSS)"

Some of the best features I found were the following:\n\nEmail is a “forwarded” or “reply” *.\nLength of subject line in email.\nOverall “wordiness” of email *.\nProportion of capital letters in subject line *.\n\n* indicates featured engineering used.\n\nResulting ROC Curve:\n\nMy final test accuracy using this model was \\(\\approx\\) 87%.\n\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM)\nUsed k-fold cross validation to optimize C value in svm.SVC function found in the scikit-learn package in Python.

For my models, I wanted high accuracy and interpretability so we can see why the model chose what it chose. This is why I decided to use two seperate models: Logistic Regression and the Random Forest Classifier.\nEDA: In the exploratory data analysis portion of building these models, I wanted to find the best way to visualize the best features for prediction. To do so, I created a heatmap of the absolute valued correlation between each feature and the diagnosis.\n\nsns.heatmap(df.corr()['Diabetes'].abs().sort_values().to_frame(), annot=True);\n\n\nFrom here, I decided to use all of ‘Age’, ‘Gender’, ‘Polyuria’, ‘Polydipsia’, ‘sudden weight loss’, ‘weakness’, ‘Polyphagia’, ‘Genital thrush’, ‘visual blurring’, ‘Irritability’, ‘partial paresis’, ‘muscle stiffness’, ‘Alopecia’, and ‘Obesity’ to make my predictions.\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nmodel = LogisticRegression(max_iter=500)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\ntrain_prediction = model.predict(X_train)\nval_prediction = model.predict(X_val)\n\ntrain_accuracy = np.mean(train_prediction == y_train)\nval_accuracy = np.mean(val_prediction == y_val)\n\nprint(f'Model training accuracy: {train_accuracy}')\nprint(f'Model validation accuracy: {val_accuracy}')\n\nModel training accuracy: 0.9302884615384616 \nModel validation accuracy: 0.9038461538461539\nHighlights:\n\n&gt;90% validation accuracy using a human interpretable model.\nModified threshold to supremum such that the model’s recall was 100% (important to minimize false negatives in many healthcare settings) while keeping validation accuracy &gt; 85% (see chunk 57).\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Classifier\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\nm2 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)\nm2.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nm2_val_prediction = m2.predict(X_val)\n\nprint(f'Model Validation Accuracy: {(tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn)}')\nprint(f'Model Precision: {tp / (tp + fp)}\\nModel Recall: {tp / (tp + fn)}')\n\nModel Validation Accuracy: 0.9807692307692307\nModel Recall: 1.0\nModel Training Accuracy: 1.0\nHighlights:\n\n&gt;=99% validation accuracy, though not human interpretable.\nKeeps highest possible validation accuracy while keeping recall at 100%.\n\nWhat I Learned\n\nHow to manipulate prediction threshold in code to maximize recall.\nThe importance of maximizing recall in a diagnosis setting.
